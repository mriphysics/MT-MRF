This repository contains all MATLAB code necessary to reproduce the results presented in the manuscript “Magnetization Transfer-Mediated Fingerprinting” - submitted to MRM.

The scripts required to generate figures in the paper are named according to each figure name. Other scripts are functions required for these files to work - please also add these to your MATLAB path. Several other plotting functions are included here and where appropriate have their copyright listed at the top of each file. This code is distributed under the MIT license. If you find these scripts useful, please cite our publication once available.
